# Student Performance Prediction - ML Project
This project is a predictive model for student performance based on demographic data such as gender, race, and other factors. The aim of the project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the academic performance of students based on these demographic factors, with the goal of identifying potential inequalities or opportunities for targeted interventions.


## What is the Project about:
To begin, the project would involve collecting data on student demographics, such as gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other relevant factors. This data could be collected from student records, surveys, or other sources.

Next, the data would need to be preprocessed and cleaned to ensure that it is ready for analysis. This might involve removing missing values, normalizing the data, or encoding categorical variables.

The next step would be to develop a machine learning model that can predict student performance based on the demographic data. This could involve using a variety of machine learning algorithms, such as regression, decision trees, or neural networks, to identify patterns in the data and make accurate predictions.

Once the model has been developed, it would need to be evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, to ensure that it is making accurate predictions. The model could also be tested using different subsets of the data to evaluate its performance under different conditions.

Finally, the model could be used to identify potential inequalities or opportunities for targeted interventions. For example, if the model shows that female students or students from certain racial or ethnic groups are more likely to struggle academically, targeted interventions could be developed to support these students and improve their academic performance.

Overall, this machine learning project has the potential to improve our understanding of the factors that contribute to student performance and to identify opportunities for targeted interventions to support student success.
